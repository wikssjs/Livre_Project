# Livre_Project

this is a web app that I created with as.net core using the MVC pattern, on this application you the user can bookmark books or remove them from their bookmark, for the moment there is no authentication yet, the bookmark is only for the user with ID 1, in the admin page you can Add, Modify or Delete a book
